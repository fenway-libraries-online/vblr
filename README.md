vblr
----

A batch record load manager for Voyager and Koha ILSes.

Some small, optional bits of vblr are still Voyager-specific.  On the other
hand, while "glue" scripts for Koha are included (koha/ils.load, etc.) they are
not included for Voyager.

This makes no sense until you learn that vblr was initially developed for
Voyager only, but that recent development has all been ILS-neutral and geared
toward making vblr work fully with Koha.
