============================== vblr configuration ==============================

Step 0. Introduction

Congratulations on choosing vblr!  It's time to configure your setup.

This step will produce the file 'config.mk', which you may edit later if you
wish.  It will not make any other changes.

There are three questions.  If you don't know the answer to any of them yet,
just enter Q to cancel, research your answers, and run this script again when
you're ready.

The three questions are:

    (*) What ILS will vblr be working with?
    (*) Where should vblr be installed?
    (*) Where should vblr keep its data files?

Press Enter when you're ready to proceed...

EOS
    read REPLY
    [ "$REPLY" != "Q" ] && [ "$REPLY" != "q" ] || cancelled
    clear

    # Which ILS?
    clear
    cat <<EOS >&2
============================== vblr configuration ==============================

Step 1.

What ILS will vblr be working with?
        
        >>> vblr is compatible with Voyager and Koha.

EOS
    while true; do
        echo -n '  Your ILS (Koha or Voyager): ' >&2
        read ILS
        echo "$ILS" | tr A-Z a-z | read ILS
        case "$ILS" in
            q|Q)
                cancelled ;;
            koha|voyager)
                break ;;
            *)  echo '    ** vblr only works with Koha or Voyager **' >&2
                ;;
        esac
    done

    # Where to install?
    clear
    cat <<EOS >&2
============================== vblr configuration ==============================

Step 2.

Where should vblr be installed?

        >>> Likely candidates are /usr/local/vblr or /opt/vblr but you may
            specify any file path.  Nothing will actually be installed yet;
            this is just for configuration purposes

EOS
    while true; do
        echo -n '  Install location: ' >&2
        read PREFIX
        case "$PREFIX" in
            q|Q)
                cancelled ;;
            /|/usr|/usr/local|/opt|/opt/local)
                echo "    ** That\'s not a good place to install things -- try adding /vblr at the end ** " >&2
                ;;
            /*) break ;;
            *)  echo '    ** You must specify an absolute path **' >&2
                ;;
        esac
    done

    # Where to put VBLR_ROOT?
    clear
    cat <<EOS >&2
============================== vblr configuration ==============================

Step 3.

Where should vblr keep its data files?

        >>> You can either use the default or specify some other location.
            All data files will be placed within it, so make sure it's
            somewhere that will get backed up regularly!

        >>> The default is: ${PREFIX}/data

EOS
    while true; do
        echo -n '  Data location: ' >&2
        read ROOT
        case "$ROOT" in
            q|Q)
                cancelled ;;
            /|/usr|/usr/local|/opt|/opt/local)
                echo "    ** That\'s not a good place to install things -- try adding /vblr at the end **" >&2
                ;;
            /*) break ;;
            '') ROOT=${PREFIX}/data
                ;;
            *) echo '    ** You must specify an absolute path **' >&2
                ;;
        esac
    done
    cat <<EOS > config.mk
ILS = $ILS
PREFIX = $PREFIX
ROOT = $ROOT
EOS
    cat <<EOS >&2

Congratulations, you've just configured vblr!

The next step is to run the "make" command.

    echo >&2
    echo 'Cancelled.  Come back again!' >&2
    exit 1
